# ARRAYS
# arrays are great for storing lists of things
# arrays can hold as many items as you want, and as many types as you want

# array of strings
student_names = ["Christine", "Isaac", "David"]


# arrays are indexed starting at zero
puts student_names[0] #=> "Christine"
puts student_names[1] #=> "Isaac"
puts student_names[2] #=> "David"
