# COMMENTS
# comments are just for YOU (and the other developers you're working with)
# the computer ignores them - in ruby a comment starts with the '#' character

# STRINGS
# we define strings by putting any number of characters
# into quotations - double quotes, or single work
"I'm a string"
'Me too'

# we can add strings together
"Hello, " + "part-timers!"
# => "Hello, part-timers"

# INTEGERS
# integers are numbers, plain and simple.
# we can add them together.
1 + 2
# => 3

# or subtract them
4 - 2
# => 2

# or multiply them
20 * 2
# => 40

# or divide
10 / 2
# => 5

# FLOATS
# floats are numbers with a decimal we can use them much the way we use integers

1.2 + 1.3
#=> 1.5
1.2 - 0.2
#=> 1.0

# NOTE: if we add an integer and a float together, ruby will always return a float

# BOOLEANS
# a boolean value is either true or false, that's it!

true
# notice how it's just the word true - if you wrap it in quotations it's then a string.

false
