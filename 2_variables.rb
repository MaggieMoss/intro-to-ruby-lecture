# VARIABLES
# we use variables when we want to save a value for use later
# variables can be thought of like bookmarks - or a little cubby hole where you
# can save a piece of information

# to define a variable in ruby we simply type the name of the variable, an equals sign
# and then the value we want to save in our variable

first_name = "Maggie"

# now I have a string ("Maggie") saved into a first_name variable

# we can save any object type into a variable
# a boolean
is_hungry = true

# a float
shoe_price = 87.95

# an integer
number_of_coffee_mugs = 4

# remember that when we define variables in ruby we use snake case - all lower case 
# letters with underscores separating words
# we want to keep our variable names as clear as possible - ask yourself if someone
# else read your code - would they understand what was happening?
