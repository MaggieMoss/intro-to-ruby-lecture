# if statements work to control the flow of our programs
# if something is true - go do a, if it's false, do b 

# when writing if statements we have to remember to have an end 
# if condition is true -> run this piece of code
if condition
  # do something
end

# Example
raining = true

if raining 
  puts "Bring an umbrella"
else 
  puts "Bring some sunglasses"
end
